/tmp/Codacy.CSharpCoverage/Codacy.CSharpCoverage.CSharpCoverage -c $REPO_COMMIT_UUID -t $CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN -r MyProject_coverage.xml -e opencover
```

### Linux or macOS w/ self-contained binary

```bash
curl -Ls https://github.com/codacy/csharp-codacy-coverage/releases/download/$CODACY_COVERAGE_VERSION/Codacy.CSharpCoverage_<linux|osx>-x64 --output Codacy.CSharpCoverage_<linux|osx>-x64

```

## FAQ

### What's the difference between the compressed archive and self-contained binary

The compressed archive is compiled using `netcoreapp2.2` framework and has all
`.dll` dependencies inside the archive. The self-contained binary is built under
the `netcoreapp3.0` framework which compiles to a single binary containing all
dependencies bundled insides. That could be useful for portability.
